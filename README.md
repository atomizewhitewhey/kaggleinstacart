Kaggle Instacart Market Basket Analysis

In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time 
to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order. 

The datasets provided are very large, hence they are stored in a separate directory. 

Currently, there are two files in the repository
1. kaggleinstacart.py
As a starter code, it is just used to explore a little bit of the datasets provided to get a better understanding of what the data entails.
It will be eventually replaced with the code that will do feature engineering and extract features from the dataset to allow
machine learning algorithms to be implemented for regression to take place.

2. Kaggle Instacart Market Basket Analysis.ipynb
Using the starter code as a base, this notebook is used to do an exploratory analysis of the datasets provided, to gain a better 
understanding of which features can be extracted from the datasets and used to implement machine learning algorithms.
